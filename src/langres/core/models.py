Data contracts for langres entity resolution framework.

This module defines the core Pydantic models that serve as type-safe
interfaces between all components:

- EntityProtocol: Protocol defining required `id` attribute for all entities
- CompanySchema: Test domain model for POC
- ERCandidate[SchemaT]: Generic normalized pair passed to Modules
- PairwiseJudgement: Rich decision output with full provenance

class EntityProtocol(Protocol):
    """Protocol defining minimum requirements for entity schemas.

    All entity schemas used in langres must have an `id` attribute
    for identification and tracking. This enables type-safe generic
    programming while allowing any Pydantic schema that has an `id` field.

    Note:
        This Protocol is used in blocker.py and module.py with TYPE_CHECKING
        to provide type safety while maintaining Pydantic compatibility.
