## Framework Architecture & Design Patterns

### PyTorch

- **URL**: <https://pytorch.org/>
- **What we learn**: Modular, composable primitives that can be combined flexibly. The `nn.Module` abstraction for stateful components with `forward()` methods. Clear separation between high-level (`torch.nn`) and low-level (`torch.Tensor`) APIs.
- **Applied in langres**: Our `Module` abstraction mirrors PyTorch's design. The two-layer API (tasks vs. core) follows PyTorch's philosophy of simple primitives + convenient wrappers.

### PyTorch Lightning

- **URL**: <https://lightning.ai/>
- **What we learn**: Separation of research/model code from engineering concerns (logging, checkpointing, distributed training). Structured training loops with clear hooks. The "organized PyTorch" philosophy.
- **Applied in langres**: Inspires our separation of matching logic (Flows) from optimization/execution concerns (Tasks, Optimizer). The `.compile()` method concept for optimization.

### FastAPI

- **URL**: <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/>
- **What we learn**: Pydantic-first design for validation and developer experience. Type hints as runtime behavior. Automatic validation, serialization, and documentation from type annotations.
- **Applied in langres**: Heavy use of Pydantic for all data models (`PairwiseJudgement`, `Candidate`, etc.). Type-driven API design. Validation at boundaries.

### SQLModel

- **URL**: <https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/>
- **What we learn**: Single source of truth for data models (Pydantic + SQLAlchemy). Reduces boilerplate by unifying validation, ORM, and serialization. Type-driven database schemas.
